1. What is an interface (include best design practices in your response)?

  An interface is any methods / functions that is used to interact with a class.

  An example, when determining the sum of two numbers with a calculator, all you
  have to do are provide the numbers and the operator, and you will get the right
  answer. However, it shouldn't matter to the user how the calculator got to the
  end result, if the answer is right. 

2. What are the three main scopes an attribute can have in a class (I am not
  referring to private, protected, public)?

  Local attributes
  Object attributes
  Class attributes

3. Considering question 2, please tell me when each scope would be appropriate.

  Local attributes are owned by a specific method.
  Object attributes are attributes that all methods in a class have access to.
  Class attributes are attributes that all instances of a class have access to.

4. What is precedural programming?
  
  Procedural programming is where code is placed in a function, and when input
  is fed to these functions, they return the output.

  For example, you can have a sum function, and when you pass two numbers (input)
  as a parameter to the function, the function returns the sum (output) of the
  two numbers.

  Furthermore any program that executes code from top to bottom can be considered
  procedural programming. 

5. Describe encapsulation.

  Encapsulation is when the details of implementation is hidden from the user.

  For example, you can use a remote control to change the channel and/or
  increase/decrease volume without knowing how that functionality is
  implemented.
