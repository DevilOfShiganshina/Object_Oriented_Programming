Using the language discussed in class; what is the difference between
aggregation and composition (remember, I consider them to both be forms of association)?

Python is a dynamically typed language. How can this be prove given the
code below?

  my_variable = 10
  while my_variable > 0:
    i = foo(my_variable)
    if i < 100:
      my_variable++
    else
      my_variable = (my_variable + i) / 10


what are the 3 main constructor types we see in C++?

what is inlining?
